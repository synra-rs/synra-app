//! The transfers this shell is running, and the command that lists them.
//!
//! # Why a registry rather than a read from the link
//!
//! Because a transfer outlives the frame that started it: it is a sequence of chunks, and the interface has to be able to ask
//! "what is in flight" between two of them. The registry is written by the worker that moves the chunks and read by
//! `transfer_list`; the two never hold the lock for longer than a lookup.
//!
//! # Why the snapshot is stored rather than derived
//!
//! The worker already has the numbers — how far along, how many blocks — and deriving them again here would be a second
//! implementation of the progress arithmetic. The snapshot is what the worker last reported, and this module's job is to
//! keep that honest rather than to improve on it.
