// @vitest-environment jsdom
/**
 * The plugins page, mounted — the one component test in this repository.
 *
 * # What makes this possible, after one failed attempt
 *
 * The first try stubbed `ant-design-vue` out of the way and everything past the second mount broke: an `AList` draws its
 * rows through the `renderItem` **scoped slot**, which a stub that only renders `slots.default` never calls. So the real
 * components stay, and what this file supplies instead is the three browser APIs jsdom does not implement and antd
 * reaches for: `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver` and `IntersectionObserver`.
 *
 * # What is asserted, and what is not
 *
 * Only what the page itself is responsible for: that mounting reads the list, that the card's words reach the DOM, that a
 * refusal is shown rather than swallowed, and that a card put in the store by **something other than the page's own read**
 * reaches the screen. Clicking through antd's confirm dialog is not tested — that is antd's behaviour, and the arguments
 * those clicks produce are asserted in `pages/plugins/actions.test.ts`.

 * installed, the first mounts still worked, and the third test died with "window.matchMedia is not a function". A guard
 * that asks the wrong question is worse than no guard: it made the first two tests pass and hid the reason.
